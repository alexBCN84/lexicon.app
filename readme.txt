# LEXICON

Lexicon is an app intended to create, manage, share and learn customized vocabulary. 
Users can create glossaries individually, collaboratively or both. 
The app will also provide a review system based on spaced repetition to practice and recall vocabulary. 
Basing our system on cognitive learning techniques, we aim to bring those new terms from short-time memory to long and even long-life memory.

### IMPORTANT NOTICE! 
This first readme serves merely as a draft paper for shaping initial states of LEXICON.
This document will be conveniently updated following the development of the application.

**Enter and save your own words for review**
**Classify your words based on categories**
**Create glossaries with links to categories**
**Set your personal goals (daily, weekly, monthly)**
    * i.e how many words you want to be able to remember by the end of (day, week, month)
**Establish links within categories (contexts in which the word may be used).**
**Establish links to other words.**
**Enter examples.**
**Create and use later on your own exercises for revision.**
**Create 'memory springs' (or tips) that will help you remember the word when you're not sure (Establish as many connections as possible).**

###Based on time spaced recalls according to cognitive and learning studies:###
  1. Short time memory (reminders every 20 minutes to look at the words up to six hours);
  2. Long time memory (test your knowledge) if OK move to state 3;
  3. Passive knowledge (test your knowledge: foreign word given... enter translation) if Ok move to state 4;
  4. Active use (test your knowledge: translation given... enter the foreign word)
    if Ok set a time reminder for when you want to review this word again
    if not Ok step down to state 3.
